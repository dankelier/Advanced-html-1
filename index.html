    <h1>Hello everyone , today we have an exotic animal to show you!</h1>
    <h1 id="name">Axalotl</h1>
    <div class="information">
        <p>As legend has it, the <span class="paragraph">axolotl</span> is the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, which disguised himself as a salamander to avoid being sacrificed. But these Mexican amphibians are impressive enough on their own, with the ability to regenerate lost limbs and stay “young” throughout their lives.

            Unlike other salamanders that undergo metamorphosis, <span class="paragraph">axolotls</span> (pronounced ACK-suh-LAH-tuhl) never outgrow their larval, juvenile stage, a phenomenon called neoteny.
